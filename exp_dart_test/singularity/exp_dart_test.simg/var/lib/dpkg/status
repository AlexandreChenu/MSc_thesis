 request retransmission of lost data, or notify an application of
 unrecoverable loss. PGM is a receiver-reliable protocol, which means the
 receiver is responsible for ensuring all data is received, absolving the
 sender of reception responsibility. PGM runs over a best effort datagram
 service, currently OpenPGM uses IP multicast but could be implemented above
 switched fabrics such as InfiniBand.

Description: X C Binding, present extension
 This package contains the library files needed to run software using
 libxcb-present, the present extension for the X C Binding.
 .
 The XCB library provides an interface to the X Window System protocol,
 designed to replace the Xlib interface.  XCB provides several advantages over
 Xlib:
 .
  * Size: small library and lower memory footprint
  * Latency hiding: batch several requests and wait for the replies later
  * Direct protocol access: one-to-one mapping between interface and protocol
  * Thread support: access XCB from multiple threads, with no explicit locking
  * Easy creation of new extensions: automatically generates interface from
    machine-parsable protocol descriptions

Description: Cairo 2D vector graphics library
 Cairo is a multi-platform library providing anti-aliased
 vector-based rendering for multiple target backends. Paths consist
 of line segments and cubic splines and can be rendered at any width
 with various join and cap styles. All colors may be specified with
 optional translucence (opacity/alpha) and combined using the
 extended Porter/Duff compositing algebra as found in the X Render
 Extension.
 .
 Cairo exports a stateful rendering API similar in spirit to the path
 construction, text, and painting operators of PostScript, (with the
 significant addition of translucence in the imaging model). When
 complete, the API is intended to support the complete imaging model of
 PDF 1.4.

 Nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in more or
 less any context: In crypto toolkits for object-oriented languages (C++,
 Python, Pike, ...), in applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in kernel
 space.
 .
 It tries to solve a problem of providing a common set of cryptographic
 algorithms for higher-level applications by implementing a
 context-independent set of cryptographic algorithms. In that light, Nettle
 doesn't do any memory allocation or I/O, it simply provides the
 cryptographic algorithms for the application to use in any environment and
 in any way it needs.
 .
 This package contains the symmetric and one-way cryptographic
 algorithms. To avoid having this package depend on libgmp, the
 asymmetric cryptos reside in a separate library, libhogweed.

Description: WebSockets support for any application/server - Python 2
 websockify was formerly named wsproxy and was part of the noVNC project.
 .
 At the most basic level, websockify just translates WebSockets traffic to
 normal socket traffic. Websockify accepts the WebSockets handshake, parses it,
 and then begins forwarding traffic between the client and the target in both
 directions.
 .
 Websockify supports all versions of the WebSockets protocol (Hixie and HyBi).
 The older Hixie versions of the protocol only support UTF-8 text payloads. In
 order to transport binary data over UTF-8 an encoding must used to encapsulate
 the data within UTF-8.
 .
 With Hixie clients, Websockify uses base64 to encode all traffic to and from
 the client. This does not affect the data between websockify and the server.
 .
 With HyBi clients, websockify negotiates whether to base64 encode traffic to
 and from the client via the subprotocol header (Sec-WebSocket-Protocol). The
 valid subprotocol values are 'binary' and 'base64' and if the client sends
 both then the server (the Python implementation) will prefer 'binary'. The
 'binary' subprotocol indicates that the data will be sent raw using binary
 WebSocket frames. Some HyBi clients (such as the Flash fallback and older
 Chrome and iOS versions) do not support binary data which is why the
 negotiation is necessary.
 .
 This package provides the Python 2 module.

 .
  * Size: small library and lower memory footprint
  * Latency hiding: batch several requests and wait for the replies later
  * Direct protocol access: one-to-one mapping between interface and protocol
  * Thread support: access XCB from multiple threads, with no explicit locking
  * Easy creation of new extensions: automatically generates interface from
    machine-parsable protocol descriptions

 instrument data or numerical model output from weather or climate
 simulations. While floating point representations are not directly
 supported, they can also be efficiently coded by grouping exponents
 and mantissa.
 .
 Libaec implements Golomb Rice coding as defined in the Space Data
 System Standard documents 121.0-B-2 [1] and 120.0-G-2[2].

 OPeNDAP provides software that allows you to access data over the internet,

 protocol which its software uses, many other groups have adopted DAP
 and provide compatible clients, servers and software development kits.
 .
 With OPeNDAP software, you access data using a URL, just like a URL you
 would use to access a web page. However, before you request any data,
 you need to know how to request it in a form your browser can handle.
 OPeNDAP data is stored in binary form, and by default, it is
 transmitted that way, too.

 need to be (re)created, and issues the commands to (re)create
 them. Make can be used to organize any task in which targets (files)
 are to be automatically updated based on input files whenever the
 corresponding input is newer --- it is not limited to building
 computer programs. Indeed, Make is a general purpose dependency

Description: atomic data types, operations, and memory ordering constraints
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 Boost.Atomic is a library that provides atomic data types and
 operations on these data types, as well as memory ordering
 constraints required for coordinating multiple threads through atomic
 variables. It implements the interface as defined by the C++11
 standard, but makes this feature available for platforms lacking
 system/compiler support for this particular C++11 feature.
 .
 Users of this library should already be familiar with concurrency in
 general, as well as elementary concepts such as "mutual exclusion".
 .
 The implementation makes use of processor-specific instructions where
 possible (via inline assembler, platform libraries or compiler
 intrinsics), and falls back to "emulating" atomic operations through
 locking.

Description: GNU grep, egrep and fgrep
 'grep' is a utility to search for text in files; it can be used from the
 command line or in scripts.  Even if you don't want to use it, other packages
 on your system probably will.
 .
 The GNU family of grep utilities may be the "fastest grep in the west".
 GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about
 twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper
 search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being
 considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to
 look at every character. The result is typically many times faster
 than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing
 will run more slowly, however.)

Description: Perl module for error/exception handling in an OO-ish way
 The Error module provides two interfaces.  Firstly "Error" provides a
 procedural interface to exception handling. Secondly "Error" is a base class
 for errors/exceptions that can either be thrown, for subsequent catch, or can
 simply be recorded.
 .
 Errors in the class "Error" should not be thrown directly, but the user
 should throw errors from a sub-class of "Error".
 .
 Warning: Using the "Error" module is no longer recommended due to the
 black-magical nature of its syntactic sugar, which often tends to break. Its
 maintainers have stopped actively writing code that uses it, and discourage
 people from doing so.
 .
 Recommended alternatives are Exception::Class (libexception-class-perl),
 Error::Exception (not packaged), TryCatch (libtrycatch-perl), and Try::Tiny
 (libtry-tiny-perl).

 .
  * Shorten time for loading menu entries.
  * Ease of use (API is very similar to that of libgnome-menu).
  * Lightweight runtime library (parsing of the menu definition files
    are done by menu-cache-gen when the menus are really changed).
  * Less unnecessary and complicated file monitoring.
  * Heavily reduced disk I/O.

Version: 0.3-4
Description: pthread stubs not provided by native libc, development files
 This library provides weak aliases for pthread functions not provided
 in libc or otherwise available by default.  Libraries like libxcb rely
 on pthread stubs to use pthreads optionally, becoming thread-safe when
 linked to libpthread, while avoiding any performance hit when running
 single-threaded. libpthread-stubs supports this behavior even on
 platforms which do not supply all the necessary pthread stubs.
 .
 On platforms which already supply all the necessary pthread stubs, this
 package ships only the pkg-config file pthread-stubs.pc, to allow
 libraries to unconditionally express a dependency on pthread-stubs and
 still obtain correct behavior.

 Libuv is the asynchronous library behind Node.js. Very similar to libevent or
 libev, it provides the main elements for event driven systems: watching and
 waiting for availability in a set of sockets, and some other events like timers
 or asynchronous messages. However, libuv also comes with some other extras
 like:
  * files watchers and asynchronous operations
  * a portable TCP and UDP API, as well as asynchronous DNS resolution
  * processes and threads management, and a portable inter-process
    communications mechanism, with pipes and work queues
  * a plugins mechanism for loading libraries dynamically
  * interface with external libraries that also need to access the I/O.
 .
 This package includes the dynamic library against which you can link
 your program.

Source: websockify
Version: 0.8.0+dfsg1-9
Description: WebSockets support for any application/server - shared files
 websockify was formerly named wsproxy and was part of the noVNC project.
 .
 At the most basic level, websockify just translates WebSockets traffic to
 normal socket traffic. Websockify accepts the WebSockets handshake, parses it,
 and then begins forwarding traffic between the client and the target in both
 directions.
 .
 Websockify supports all versions of the WebSockets protocol (Hixie and HyBi).
 The older Hixie versions of the protocol only support UTF-8 text payloads. In
 order to transport binary data over UTF-8 an encoding must used to encapsulate
 the data within UTF-8.
 .
 With Hixie clients, Websockify uses base64 to encode all traffic to and from
 the client. This does not affect the data between websockify and the server.
 .
 With HyBi clients, websockify negotiates whether to base64 encode traffic to
 and from the client via the subprotocol header (Sec-WebSocket-Protocol). The
 valid subprotocol values are 'binary' and 'base64' and if the client sends
 both then the server (the Python implementation) will prefer 'binary'. The
 'binary' subprotocol indicates that the data will be sent raw using binary
 WebSocket frames. Some HyBi clients (such as the Flash fallback and older
 Chrome and iOS versions) do not support binary data which is why the
 negotiation is necessary.
 .
 This package provides common files for Python 2 and 3 modules.

Description: parsing library for openbox
 Openbox works with your applications, and makes your desktop easier to manage.
 This is because the approach to its development was the opposite of what seems
 to be the general case for window managers. Openbox was written first to
 comply with standards and to work properly. Only when that was in place did
 the team turn to the visual interface.
 .
 Openbox is fully functional as a stand-alone working environment, or can be
 used as a drop-in replacement for the default window manager in the GNOME or
 KDE desktop environments.
 .
 Openbox 3 is a completely new breed of window manager. It is not based upon
 any existing code base, although the visual appearance has been based upon
 that of Blackbox. Openbox 2 was based on the Blackbox 0.65.0 codebase.
 .
 This package contains the libobt library files used by openbox
 to load and parse configuration and theme files of openbox.

 is a new awk meaning it implements the AWK language as defined in Aho,
 Kernighan and Weinberger, The AWK Programming Language, Addison-Wesley
 Publishing, 1988. (Hereafter referred to as the AWK book.) Mawk conforms
 to the POSIX 1003.2 (draft 11.3) definition of the AWK language
 which contains a few features not described in the AWK book, and mawk
 provides a small number of extensions.
 .
 Mawk is smaller and much faster than gawk. It has some compile-time
 limits such as NF = 32767 and sprintf buffer = 1020.

Description: standards-compliant, fast, light-weight and extensible window manager
 Openbox works with your applications, and makes your desktop easier to manage.
 This is because the approach to its development was the opposite of what seems
 to be the general case for window managers. Openbox was written first to
 comply with standards and to work properly. Only when that was in place did
 the team turn to the visual interface.
 .
 Openbox is fully functional as a stand-alone working environment, or can be
 used as a drop-in replacement for the default window manager in the GNOME or
 KDE desktop environments.
 .
 Openbox 3 is a completely new breed of window manager. It is not based upon
 any existing code base, although the visual appearance has been based upon
 that of Blackbox. Openbox 2 was based on the Blackbox 0.65.0 codebase.
 .
 Some of the things to look for in Openbox are:
 .
  * ICCCM and EWMH compliance!
  * Very fast
  * Chainable key bindings
  * Customizable mouse actions
  * Window resistance
  * Multi-head Xinerama support!
  * Pipe menus

Description: High quality 1D sample-rate conversion library
 The SoX Resampler library `libsoxr' performs one-dimensional sample-rate
 conversion - it may be used, for example, to resample PCM-encoded audio.
 .
 It aims to give fast and high quality results for any constant (rational or
 irrational) resampling ratio. Phase-response, preserved bandwidth, aliasing,
 and rejection level parameters are all configurable; alternatively, simple
 `preset' configurations may be selected.
 .
 A simple API is provided that allows interfacing using commonly-used sample
 formats and buffering schemes.

Version: 1.65.1+dfsg-0ubuntu5
Description: atomic data types, operations, and memory ordering constraints
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 Boost.Atomic is a library that provides atomic data types and
 operations on these data types, as well as memory ordering
 constraints required for coordinating multiple threads through atomic
 variables. It implements the interface as defined by the C++11
 standard, but makes this feature available for platforms lacking
 system/compiler support for this particular C++11 feature.
 .
 Users of this library should already be familiar with concurrency in
 general, as well as elementary concepts such as "mutual exclusion".
 .
 The implementation makes use of processor-specific instructions where
 possible (via inline assembler, platform libraries or compiler
 intrinsics), and falls back to "emulating" atomic operations through
 locking.

Description: wayland compositor infrastructure - client library
 Wayland is a protocol for a compositor to talk to its clients as well
 as a C library implementation of that protocol. The compositor can be
 a standalone display server running on Linux kernel modesetting and
 evdev input devices, an X application, or a wayland client
 itself. The clients can be traditional applications, X servers
 (rootless or fullscreen) or other display servers.
 .
 This package ships the library that implements the client side of
 the Wayland protocol.

Description: FFmpeg library with de/encoders for audio/video codecs - runtime files
 FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode, transcode,
 mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and
 machines have created. It supports the most obscure ancient formats up to the
 cutting edge.
 .
 This library provides a generic encoding/decoding framework and
 contains multiple decoders and encoders for audio, video and subtitle streams,
 and several bitstream filters.
 .
 The shared architecture provides various services ranging from bit stream I/O
 to DSP optimizations, and makes it suitable for implementing robust and fast
 codecs as well as for experimentation.
 .
 This package contains the runtime files.

Description: X11 utilities
 An X client is a program that interfaces with an X server (almost always via
 the X libraries), and thus with some input and output hardware like a
 graphics card, monitor, keyboard, and pointing device (such as a mouse).
 .
 This package provides a miscellaneous assortment of X utilities
 that ship with the X Window System, including:
  - appres, editres, listres and viewres, which query the X resource database;
  - luit, a filter that can be run between an arbitrary application and a
    UTF-8 terminal emulator;
  - xdpyinfo, a display information utility for X;
  - xdriinfo, query configuration information of DRI drivers;
  - xev, an X event displayer;
  - xfd, a tool that displays all the glyphs in a given X font;
  - xfontsel, a tool for browsing and selecting X fonts;
  - xkill, a tool for terminating misbehaving X clients;
  - xlsatoms, which lists interned atoms defined on an X server;
  - xlsclients, which lists client applications running on an X display;
  - xlsfonts, a server font list displayer;
  - xmessage, a tool to display message or dialog boxes;
  - xprop, a property displayer for X;
  - xvinfo, an Xv extension information utility for X;
  - xwininfo, a window information utility for X;
 .
 The editres and viewres programs use bitmap images provided by the
 xbitmaps package. The luit program requires locale information from
 the libx11-data package.

Description: HTTP library implementation in C -- GNOME support library
 It was originally part of a SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)
 implementation called Soup, but the SOAP and non-SOAP parts have now been
 split into separate packages.
 .
 libsoup uses the Glib main loop and is designed to work well with GTK+
 applications.  This enables GNOME applications to access HTTP servers
 on the network in a completely asynchronous fashion, very similar to
 the GTK+ programming model (a synchronous operation mode is also
 supported for those who want it).
 .
 The GNOME support library is used for features which are important to
 GNOME apps, but which require GNOME-specific libraries that non-GNOME
 apps may not want to add dependencies on.
 .
 Features:
  * Both asynchronous (GMainLoop and callback-based) and synchronous APIs
  * Automatically caches connections
  * SSL Support using GnuTLS
  * Proxy support, including authentication and SSL tunneling
  * Client support for Digest, NTLM, and Basic authentication
  * Server support for Digest and Basic authentication
  * Basic client-side SOAP and XML-RPC support
 .
 This package contains the GNOME support shared library.

Description: serialization library for C++
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection,
 containing the following functionalities:
 .
  * proper restoration of pointers to shared data
  * serialization of STL containers and other commonly used templates
  * data portability - streams of bytes created on one platform should
    be readable on any other
  * archive interface must be rich enough to permit the creation of an
    archive that presents serialized data as XML in a useful manner
 .
 Here, "serialization" means the reversible deconstruction of an
 arbitrary set of C++ data structures to a sequence of bytes.
 archive: to refer to a specific rendering of this stream of bytes.

Description: Layout and rendering of internationalized text
 Pango is a library for layout and rendering of text, with an emphasis
 on internationalization. Pango can be used anywhere that text layout is
 needed. however, most of the work on Pango-1.0 was done using the GTK+
 widget toolkit as a test platform. Pango forms the core of text and
 font handling for GTK+-2.0.
 .
 Pango is designed to be modular; the core Pango layout can be used with
 four different font backends:
  - Core X windowing system fonts
  - Client-side fonts on X using the Xft library
  - Direct rendering of scalable fonts using the FreeType library
  - Native fonts on Microsoft backends
 .
 This package contains the shared libraries.

 Implementation of IEC 61883, part 1 (CIP, plug registers, and CMP), part 2
 (DV-SD), part 4 (MPEG2-TS), and part 6 (AMDTP). Outside of IIDC, nearly all
 FireWire multimedia devices use IEC 61883 protocols.
 .
 The libiec61883 library provides a higher level API for streaming DV,
 MPEG-2 and audio over Linux IEEE 1394. This includes both reception and
 transmission. It uses the new "rawiso" API of libraw1394, which
 transparently provides mmap-ed DMA for efficient data transfer. It also
 represents the third generation of I/O technology for Linux 1394 for
 these media types thereby removing the complexities of additional kernel
 modules, /dev nodes, and procfs. It also consolidates features for plug
 control registers and connection management that previously existed in
 experimental form in an unreleased version of libavc1394.

Description: The Speex codec runtime library
 Speex is an audio codec especially designed for compressing voice at low
 bit-rates for applications such as voice over IP (VoIP). In some senses,
 it is meant to be complementary to the Vorbis codec which places a greater
 emphasis on high-quality music reproduction.
 .
 This package provides the speex runtime library.

Description: Library for managing RDMA connections
 librdmacm is a library that allows applications to set up reliable
 connected and unreliable datagram transfers when using RDMA adapters.
 It provides a transport-neutral interface in the sense that the same
 code can be used for both InfiniBand and iWARP adapters.  The
 interface is based on sockets, but adapted for queue pair (QP) based
 semantics: communication must use a specific RDMA device, and data
 transfers are message-based.
 .
 librdmacm only provides communication management (connection setup
 and tear-down) and works in conjunction with the verbs interface
 provided by libibverbs, which provides the interface used to actually
 transfer data.
 .
 This package contains the shared library.

Description: C++ representation of time duration, time point, and clocks
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 The Boost.Chrono library provides:
 .
  * A means to represent time durations: managed by the generic
 duration class . Examples of time durations include days, minutes,
 seconds and nanoseconds, which can be represented with a fixed number
 of clock ticks per unit. All of these units of time duration are
 united with a generic interface by the duration facility.
  * A type for representing points in time: time_point. A time_point
 represents an epoch plus or minus a duration. The library leaves
 epochs unspecified. A time_point is associated with a clock.
  * Several clocks, some of which may not be available on a
 particular platform: system_clock, steady_clock and
 high_resolution_clock. A clock is a pairing of a time_point and
 duration, and a function which returns a time_point representing now.
 .
 To make the timing facilities more generally useful, Boost.Chrono
 provides a number of clocks that are thin wrappers around the
 operating system's time APIs, thereby allowing the extraction of wall
 clock time, user CPU time, system CPU time spent by the process:
 .
  * process_real_cpu_clock, captures wall clock CPU time spent by the
 current process.
  * process_user_cpu_clock, captures user-CPU time
 spent by the current process.
  * process_system_cpu_clock, captures
 system-CPU time spent by the current process.
  * A tuple-like class
 process_cpu_clock, that captures real, user-CPU, and system-CPU
 process times together.
  * A thread_clock thread steady clock giving
 the time spent by the current thread (when supported by a platform).
 .
 Lastly, Boost.Chrono includes typeof registration for duration and
 time_point to permit using emulated auto with C++03 compilers.

Description: X terminal emulator
 xterm is a terminal emulator for the X Window System.  It provides DEC VT102
 and Tektronix 4014 compatible terminals for programs that cannot use the
 window system directly.  This version implements ISO/ANSI colors and most of
 the control sequences used by DEC VT220 terminals.
 .
 This package provides four commands: xterm, which is the traditional
 terminal emulator; uxterm, which is a wrapper around xterm that is
 intelligent about locale settings (especially those which use the UTF-8
 character encoding), but which requires the luit program from the x11-utils
 package; koi8rxterm, a wrapper similar to uxterm for locales that use the
 KOI8-R character set; and lxterm, a simple wrapper that chooses which of the
 previous commands to execute based on the user's locale settings.
 .
 A complete list of control sequences supported by the X terminal emulator
 is provided in /usr/share/doc/xterm.
 .
 The xterm program uses bitmap images provided by the xbitmaps package.
 .
 Those interested in using koi8rxterm will likely want to install the
 xfonts-cyrillic package as well.

Description: FFmpeg library for audio resampling, rematrixing etc. - runtime files
 FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode, transcode,
 mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and
 machines have created. It supports the most obscure ancient formats up to the
 cutting edge.
 .
 This library provides performs highly optimized audio resampling, rematrixing
 and sample format conversion operations.
 Specifically, this library performs the following conversions:
  * Resampling is the process of changing the audio rate, for example from a
    high sample rate of 44100Hz to 8000Hz. Audio conversion from high to low
    sample rate is a lossy process. Several resampling options and algorithms
    are available.
  * Rematrixing is the process of changing the channel layout, for example from
    stereo to mono. When the input channels cannot be mapped to the output
    streams, the process is lossy, since it involves different gain factors
    and mixing. Various other audio conversions (e.g. stretching and padding)
    are enabled through dedicated options.
  * Format conversion is the process of converting the type of samples, for
    example from 16-bit signed samples to unsigned 8-bit or float samples.
    It also handles packing conversion, when passing from packed layout (all
    samples belonging to distinct channels interleaved in the same buffer), to
    planar layout (all samples belonging to the same channel stored in a
    dedicated buffer or "plane").
 .

Description: Direct solution of large, sparse systems of linear equations
 SuperLU is a general purpose library for the direct solution of
 large, sparse, nonsymmetric systems of linear equations on high
 performance machines.
 .
 The library is written in C and is callable from either C or Fortran.
 The library routines will perform an LU decomposition with partial
 pivoting and triangular system solves through forward and back
 substitution. The LU factorization routines can handle non-square
 matrices but the triangular solves are performed only for square
 matrices. The matrix columns may be preordered (before factorization)
 either through library or user supplied routines. This preordering
 for sparsity is completely separate from the factorization. Working
 precision iterative refinement subroutines are provided for improved
 backward stability. Routines are also provided to equilibrate the
 system, estimate the condition number, calculate the relative
 backward error, and estimate error bounds for the refined solutions.
 .
 This package contains the SuperLU shared library.

Description: WebSockets support for any application/server
 websockify was formerly named wsproxy and was part of the noVNC project.
 .
 At the most basic level, websockify just translates WebSockets traffic to
 normal socket traffic. Websockify accepts the WebSockets handshake, parses it,
 and then begins forwarding traffic between the client and the target in both
 directions.
 .
 Websockify supports all versions of the WebSockets protocol (Hixie and HyBi).
 The older Hixie versions of the protocol only support UTF-8 text payloads. In
 order to transport binary data over UTF-8 an encoding must used to encapsulate
 the data within UTF-8.
 .
 With Hixie clients, Websockify uses base64 to encode all traffic to and from
 the client. This does not affect the data between websockify and the server.
 .
 With HyBi clients, websockify negotiates whether to base64 encode traffic to
 and from the client via the subprotocol header (Sec-WebSocket-Protocol). The
 valid subprotocol values are 'binary' and 'base64' and if the client sends
 both then the server (the Python implementation) will prefer 'binary'. The
 'binary' subprotocol indicates that the data will be sent raw using binary
 WebSocket frames. Some HyBi clients (such as the Flash fallback and older
 Chrome and iOS versions) do not support binary data which is why the
 negotiation is necessary.

 times faster at decompression.
 .
 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text
 compression algorithm, and Huffman coding. Compression is generally
 considerably better than that achieved by more conventional
 LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM
 family of statistical compressors.
 .

Description: Update Configuration File(s): preserve user changes to config files
 Debian policy mandates that user changes to configuration files must be
 preserved during package upgrades. The easy way to achieve this behavior
 is to make the configuration file a 'conffile', in which case dpkg
 handles the file specially during upgrades, prompting the user as
 needed.
 .
 This is appropriate only if it is possible to distribute a default
 version that will work for most installations, although some system
 administrators may choose to modify it. This implies that the
 default version will be part of the package distribution, and must
 not be modified by the maintainer scripts during installation (or at
 any other time).
 .
 This script attempts to provide conffile-like handling for files that
 may not be labelled conffiles, and are not shipped in a Debian package,
 but handled by the postinst instead. This script allows one to
 maintain files in /etc, preserving user changes and in general
 offering the same facilities while upgrading that dpkg normally
 provides for 'conffiles'.
 .
 Additionally, this script provides facilities for transitioning a
 file that had not been provided with conffile-like protection to come
 under this schema, and attempts to minimize questions asked at
 installation time. Indeed, the transitioning facility is better than the
 one offered by dpkg while transitioning a file from a non-conffile to
 conffile status.

    be readable on any other
  * archive interface must be rich enough to permit the creation of an
    archive that presents serialized data as XML in a useful manner
 .
 Here, "serialization" means the reversible deconstruction of an
 arbitrary set of C++ data structures to a sequence of bytes.
 archive: to refer to a specific rendering of this stream of bytes.

 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text
 compression algorithm, and Huffman coding.  Compression is generally
 considerably better than that achieved by more conventional
 LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM
 family of statistical compressors.

 the team turn to the visual interface.
 .
 Openbox is fully functional as a stand-alone working environment, or can be
 used as a drop-in replacement for the default window manager in the GNOME or
 KDE desktop environments.
 .
 Openbox 3 is a completely new breed of window manager. It is not based upon
 any existing code base, although the visual appearance has been based upon
 that of Blackbox. Openbox 2 was based on the Blackbox 0.65.0 codebase.

 space.
 .
 It tries to solve a problem of providing a common set of cryptographic
 algorithms for higher-level applications by implementing a
 context-independent set of cryptographic algorithms. In that light, Nettle
 doesn't do any memory allocation or I/O, it simply provides the
 cryptographic algorithms for the application to use in any environment and
 in any way it needs.
 .
 This package contains the asymmetric cryptographic algorithms, which,
 require the GNU multiple precision arithmetic library (libgmp) for
 their large integer computations.

Description: Font rendering engine for Complex Scripts -- library
 Graphite is a system that can be used to create and use "smart fonts" capable
 of displaying writing systems with various complex behaviors, such as:
 contextual shaping, ligatures, reordering, split glyphs, bidirectionality,
 stacking diacritics and complex positioning.
 .
 This library was designed and developed by the NRSI (Non-Roman Script
 Initiative) within SIL International (www.sil.org) to act as a complement to
 other smart font rendering technologies with limited practical local
 extensibility. Its purpose is to help meet the needs of a very large number
 of "minority language" communities for local extensibility of complex script
 behaviors.
 .
 The behavior of the rendering engine for a given writing system is specified
 through extra tables added to a TrueType font.  These tables are generated by
 compiling a GDL (Graphite Description Language) source file into a font using
 grcompiler.
 .
 This package contains the shared library.

Description: Bauer stereophonic-to-binaural DSP library
 The Bauer stereophonic-to-binaural DSP (bs2b) is designed to improve
 headphone listening of stereo audio records.
 .
 Typical stereo recordings are made for listening with speakers.
 What's missing in headphones is the sound going from each channel
 to the opposite ear, arriving a short time later for the extra distance
 traveled, and with a bit of high frequency roll-off for the shadowing
 effect of the head. The time delay to the far ear should also be
 somewhat longer at low frequencies than at high frequencies. bs2b
 implements both of these ideas to transform stereophonic recordings
 for headphone listening.

    o A CSSOM like API. CSSOM stands for Cascading Style Sheet Object Model.
 .
    The libcroco parser implements the CSS Level 2 specification, the CSS
    forward compatibility rules and the CSS cascading rules.
 .
  * A CSS2 selection engine
    Given an xml element node (that obviously comes from an xml document) and
    a stylesheet cascade, the Libcroco selection engine can evaluate the css
    selectors of the cascade and return the style properties associated to
    the xml element node.
 .
    Note that the xml manipulation toolkit used by the libcroco selection
    engine at the moment is libxml2.

 Pango is a library for layout and rendering of text, with an emphasis
 on internationalization. Pango can be used anywhere that text layout is
 needed. however, most of the work on Pango-1.0 was done using the GTK+
 widget toolkit as a test platform. Pango forms the core of text and
 font handling for GTK+-2.0.
 .
 Pango is designed to be modular; the core Pango layout can be used with
 four different font backends:
  - Core X windowing system fonts
  - Client-side fonts on X using the Xft library
  - Direct rendering of scalable fonts using the FreeType library
  - Native fonts on Microsoft backends
 .
 This package contains the shared libraries.

 the highest resistance against GPU cracking attacks.
 .
 Argon2i and Argon2d are parametrized by:
  * A time cost, which defines the amount of computation realized and
    therefore the execution time, given in number of iterations
  * A memory cost, which defines the memory usage, given in kibibytes
  * A parallelism degree, which defines the number of parallel threads
 .

Description: X C Binding, render extension, development files
 This package contains the header and library files needed to build software
 using libxcb-render, the render extension for the X C Binding.
 .
 The XCB library provides an interface to the X Window System protocol,
 designed to replace the Xlib interface.  XCB provides several advantages over
 Xlib:
 .
  * Size: small library and lower memory footprint
  * Latency hiding: batch several requests and wait for the replies later
  * Direct protocol access: one-to-one mapping between interface and protocol
  * Thread support: access XCB from multiple threads, with no explicit locking
  * Easy creation of new extensions: automatically generates interface from
    machine-parsable protocol descriptions

Description: converts plain array images into multi-size representation
 The LiquidRescale (lqr) library provides a C/C++ API for performing
 non-uniform resizing of images by the seam-carving technique.
 .
 The library takes images in plain array format as input and converts
 them to a multi-size representation.
 .
 Following is a list of features:
 .
   * Areas in the image can be marked for preservation or discard
   * Once the image has been fully processed, the scaling can be done
     in real-time. In fact, the information can be saved and read out
     later without any further processing
   * The resizing is done with a single function which automatically
     performs all the necessary operations; it can also work in
     successive steps without wasting computational time
   * Possibility to tune the carving operation by letting the seams be
     less connected, or more rigid, or both
   * Can export and import the visibility map (the seams)
   * Other images can be attached and undergo the same carving process
     as the parent image
   * The automatic feature detection algorithm can be tuned by
     selecting among different energy gradient functions
   * Reports progress through a customizable interface
   * A signalling system permits one to cleanly handle errors
 .
 The library implements the algorithm described in the paper "Seam
 Carving for Content-Aware Image Resizing" by Shai Avidan and Ariel
 Shamir, which can be found at
 http://www.faculty.idc.ac.il/arik/imret.pdf
 .

  * Latency hiding: batch several requests and wait for the replies later
  * Direct protocol access: one-to-one mapping between interface and protocol
  * Thread support: access XCB from multiple threads, with no explicit locking
  * Easy creation of new extensions: automatically generates interface from
    machine-parsable protocol descriptions

 CreateCursor request for rendering cursors.  Where the Render extension is
 not supported, Xcursor maps the cursor image to a standard X cursor and uses
 the core X protocol CreateCursor request.

Description: library to determine the call-chain of a program - runtime
 The primary goal of this project is to define a portable and efficient C
 programming interface (API) to determine the call-chain of a program.
 The API additionally provides the means to manipulate the preserved
 (callee-saved) state of each call-frame and to resume execution at any
 point in the call-chain (non-local goto). The API supports both local
 (same-process) and remote (across-process) operation. As such, the API
 is useful in a number of applications.

Description: FFmpeg library for image scaling and various conversions - runtime files
 FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode, transcode,
 mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and
 machines have created. It supports the most obscure ancient formats up to the
 cutting edge.
 .
 This library performs highly optimized image scaling and colorspace and pixel
 format conversion operations.
 Specifically, this library performs the following conversions:
  * Rescaling is the process of changing the video size. Several rescaling
    options and algorithms are available. This is usually a lossy process.
  * Pixel format conversion is the process of converting the image format and
    colorspace of the image, for example from planar YUV420P to RGB24 packed.
    It also handles packing conversion, that is converts from packed layout
    (all pixels belonging to distinct planes interleaved in the same buffer),
    to planar layout (all samples belonging to the same plane stored in a
    dedicated buffer or "plane"). This is usually a lossy process in case the
    source and destination colorspaces differ.
 .
 This package contains the runtime files.

 is an order of magnitude faster for most inputs, but the resulting
 compressed files are anywhere from 20% to 100% bigger. On a single core
 of a Core i7 processor in 64-bit mode, Snappy compresses at about 250
 MB/sec or more and decompresses at about 500 MB/sec or more.

 a.k.a. XenoCollide) algorithm as published in Game Programming Gems 7. libccd
 is one of the very few open source libraries that include MPR algorithm working
 in 3-D space.  However, there is a library called mpr2d, implemented in D
 programming language, that works in 2-D space.

Description: User space provider drivers for libibverbs
 libibverbs is a library that allows userspace processes to use RDMA
 "verbs" as described in the InfiniBand Architecture Specification and
 the RDMA Protocol Verbs Specification.  iWARP ethernet NICs support
 RDMA over hardware-offloaded TCP/IP, while InfiniBand is a
 high-throughput, low-latency networking technology.  InfiniBand host
 channel adapters (HCAs) and iWARP NICs commonly support direct
 hardware access from userspace (kernel bypass), and libibverbs
 supports this when available.
 .
 A RDMA driver consists of a kernel portion and a user space portion.
 This package contains the user space verbs drivers:

 The XCB library provides an interface to the X Window System protocol,
 designed to replace the Xlib interface.  XCB provides several advantages over
 Xlib:
 .
  * Size: small library and lower memory footprint
  * Latency hiding: batch several requests and wait for the replies later
  * Direct protocol access: one-to-one mapping between interface and protocol
  * Thread support: access XCB from multiple threads, with no explicit locking
  * Easy creation of new extensions: automatically generates interface from
    machine-parsable protocol descriptions

Description: retrieves files from the web
 Wget is a network utility to retrieve files from the web
 using HTTP(S) and FTP, the two most widely used internet
 protocols. It works non-interactively, so it will work in
 the background, after having logged off. The program supports
 recursive retrieval of web-authoring pages as well as FTP
 sites -- you can use Wget to make mirrors of archives and
 home pages or to travel the web like a WWW robot.
 .
 Wget works particularly well with slow or unstable connections
 by continuing to retrieve a document until the document is fully
 downloaded. Re-getting files from where it left off works on
 servers (both HTTP and FTP) that support it. Both HTTP and FTP
 retrievals can be time stamped, so Wget can see if the remote
 file has changed since the last retrieval and automatically
 retrieve the new version if it has.
 .
 Wget supports proxy servers; this can lighten the network load,
 speed up retrieval, and provide access behind firewalls.

Description: IJS raster image transport protocol: shared library
 IJS is, first and foremost, a protocol for transmission of raster page
 images. This snapshot provides a reference implementation of the protocol,
 the design of which is still in flux. When the protocol specification is
 published, it will be authoritative. Applications should feel free to link
 against the library provided in this package, adapt that code for their own
 needs, or roll a completely new implementation.
 .
 IJS is a client-server protocol, used to write ghostscript drivers. The
 drivers are separate programs. The client and server communicate via pipes,
 though shared memory may be used additionally in the future. Currently IJS
 is used by the hpijs and ijsgimpprint drivers.
 .
 Code for both the client- and server-side is included in the library. This
 package provides the shared library.

Description: Vertical Blanking Interval decoder (VBI) - common files
 The vertical blanking interval (VBI) is an interval in a television signal
 that temporarily suspends transmission of the signal for the electron gun
 to move back up to the first line of the television screen to trace the
 next screen field.
 .
 The vertical blanking interval can be used to carry data, since anything
 sent during the VBI would naturally not be displayed; various test signals,
 closed captioning, and other digital data can be sent during this time
 period. These include information like closed-caption data, Teletext
 (primarily in Europe), and now Intercast and the ATVEC Internet television
 encodings.
 .
 The Zapping VBI library, in short ZVBI, provides functions to capture and
 decode VBI data. It is written in plain ANSI C with few dependencies on
 other tools and libraries, licensed under GPL. Some features:
   * Captures raw VBI samples from V4L, V4L2 and FreeBSD BKTR devices, sliced
     VBI data from Linux DVB devices;
   * Implements a VBI Proxy to share one VBI device between multiple
     applications;
   * Has a robust and versatile bit slicer which handles a wide range of data
     services;
   * Functions to capture multiple data services at once, such as Closed
     Caption (both NTSC and PAL), Teletext, VPS, WSS, XDS;
   * Level 3.5 Teletext decoder with support for all Teletext character sets,
     graphics, 4096 colors, with built-in page cache including search
     functions;
   * Closed Caption decoder which supports roll-up, pop-up and paint-on style
     caption, color, expanded character set, text attributes and free text
     placement;
   * Renders Teletext and Caption pages, can export to HTML, PNG and other
     formats.
   * Can determine network names;
   * Can find Teletext subtitle and program pages;
   * Functions to extract data transmissions in Teletext streams (currently
     Page Format Clear and Independent Data Line Format A);
   * Can multiplex and demultiplex DVB VBI PES and TS streams.
 .
 This package contains internationalization files.

 two files differ.  `cmp' can also show all the characters that
 differ between the two files, side by side.  `diff3' shows differences
 among three files.  `sdiff' merges two files interactively.
 .
 The set of differences produced by `diff' can be used to distribute
 updates to text files (such as program source code) to other people.
 This method is especially useful when the differences are small compared
 to the complete files.  Given `diff' output, the `patch' program can
 update, or "patch", a copy of the file.

Description: Fortran77 subroutines to solve large scale eigenvalue problems
 ARPACK software is capable of solving large scale symmetric,
 nonsymmetric, and generalized eigenproblems from significant
 application areas. The software is designed to compute a few (k)
 eigenvalues with user specified features such as those of largest
 real part or largest magnitude. Storage requirements are on the order
 of n*k locations. No auxiliary storage is required. A set of Schur
 basis vectors for the desired k-dimensional eigen-space is computed
 which is numerically orthogonal to working precision. Numerically
 accurate eigenvectors are available on request.
 .
 Important Features:
 .
  * Reverse Communication Interface.
  * Single and Double Precision Real Arithmetic Versions for Symmetric,
    Non-symmetric,
  * Standard or Generalized Problems.
  * Single and Double Precision Complex Arithmetic Versions for Standard or
    Generalized Problems.
  * Routines for Banded Matrices - Standard or Generalized Problems.
  * Routines for The Singular Value Decomposition.
  * Example driver routines that may be used as templates to implement
    numerous Shift-Invert strategies for all problem types, data types and
    precision.

Description: C++ representation of time duration, time point, and clocks
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 The Boost.Chrono library provides:
 .
  * A means to represent time durations: managed by the generic duration
    class.Examples of time durations include days, minutes, seconds and
    nanoseconds, which can be represented with a fixed number of clock
    ticks per unit. All of these units of time duration are united with
    a generic interface by the duration facility.
  * A type for representing points in time: time_point. A time_point
    represents an epoch plus or minus a duration. The library leaves
    epochs unspecified. A time_point is associated with a clock.
  * Several clocks, some of which may not be available on a particular
    platform: system_clock, steady_clock and high_resolution_clock. A
    clock is a pairing of a time_point and duration, and a function
    which returns a time_point representing now.
 .
 To make the timing facilities more generally useful, Boost.Chrono
 provides a number of clocks that are thin wrappers around the
 operating system's time APIs, thereby allowing the extraction of wall
 clock time, user CPU time, system CPU time spent by the process:
 .
  * process_real_cpu_clock, captures wall clock CPU time spent by the
    current process.
  * process_user_cpu_clock, captures user-CPU time spent by the current
    process.
  * process_system_cpu_clock, captures system-CPU time spent by the
    current process.
  * a tuple-like class process_cpu_clock, that captures real, user-CPU,
    and system-CPU process times together.
  * a thread_clock thread steady clock giving the time spent by the
    current thread (when supported by a platform).
 .
 Lastly, Boost.Chrono includes typeof registration for duration and
 time_point to permit using emulated auto with C++03 compilers.

Description: Software implementation of the OpenAL audio API (shared library)
 OpenAL, the Open Audio Library, is a joint effort to create an open,
 vendor-neutral, cross-platform API for interactive, primarily spatialized
 audio. OpenAL's primary audience are application developers and desktop
 users that rely on portable standards like OpenGL, for games and other
 multimedia applications.
 .
 This library is meant as a compatible update/replacement to the OpenAL Sample
 Implementation (the SI). The SI has been unmaintained for quite a while, and
 would require a lot of work to clean up. This is a fork the old Windows version
 to attempt an accelerated ALSA version of an OpenAL implementation.
 .
 OpenAL Soft supports mono, stereo, 4-channel, 5.1, 6.1, and 7.1 output, as
 opposed to the SI's 4-channel max (though it did have some provisions for 6
 channel, this was not 5.1, and was seemingly a "late" addition). OpenAL Soft
 does not support the Vorbis and MP3 extensions, however those were considered
 deprecated even in the SI. It does, though, support some of the newer
 extensions like AL_EXT_FLOAT32 and AL_EXT_MCFORMATS for multi-channel and
 floating-point formats, as well as ALC_EXT_EFX for environmental audio effects,
 and others.
 .
 This package installs the OpenAL Soft shared library.

Description: curses-based PIN or pass-phrase entry dialog for GnuPG
 This package contains a program that allows for secure entry of PINs or

 This functionality is particularly useful for entering pass phrases
 when using encryption software such as GnuPG or e-mail clients using
 the same.  It uses an open protocol and is therefore not tied to
 particular software.
 .
 The program contained in this package implements a PIN entry dialog
 using the curses tool kit, meaning that it is useful for users
 working in text mode without the X Window System.  There are sibling
 packages that implement PIN entry dialogs that use an X tool kit.  If
 you install any of the graphical packages then this package is not
 necessary because the sibling packages automatically fall back to
 text mode if X is not active.

 .
 Regular expressions are a form of pattern-matching that are often

 utilities grep, sed and awk, and the programming language perl, each
 of which make extensive use of regular expressions. Traditionally C++
 users have been limited to the POSIX C APIs for manipulating regular
 expressions, and while regex does provide these APIs, they do not
 represent the best way to use the library. For example regex can cope
 with wide character strings, or search and replace operations (in a
 manner analogous to either sed or perl), something that traditional C
 libraries can not do.
 .
 This package is a dependency package, which depends on Debian's default
 Boost version (currently 1.65).

 Xlib:
 .
  * Size: small library and lower memory footprint
  * Latency hiding: batch several requests and wait for the replies later
  * Direct protocol access: one-to-one mapping between interface and protocol
  * Thread support: access XCB from multiple threads, with no explicit locking
  * Easy creation of new extensions: automatically generates interface from
    machine-parsable protocol descriptions

Description: regular expression library for C++
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 Regular expressions are a form of pattern-matching that are often
 used in text processing; many users will be familiar with the Unix
 utilities grep, sed and awk, and the programming language perl, each
 of which make extensive use of regular expressions. Traditionally C++
 users have been limited to the POSIX C APIs for manipulating regular
 expressions, and while regex does provide these APIs, they do not
 represent the best way to use the library. For example regex can cope
 with wide character strings, or search and replace operations (in a
 manner analogous to either sed or perl), something that traditional C
 libraries can not do.

Description: simple interprocess messaging system (daemon and utilities)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in

 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be
 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.
 .
 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.
 .
 This package contains the D-Bus daemon and related utilities.

Description: Vertical Blanking Interval decoder (VBI) - runtime files
 The vertical blanking interval (VBI) is an interval in a television signal
 that temporarily suspends transmission of the signal for the electron gun
 to move back up to the first line of the television screen to trace the
 next screen field.
 .
 The vertical blanking interval can be used to carry data, since anything
 sent during the VBI would naturally not be displayed; various test signals,
 closed captioning, and other digital data can be sent during this time
 period. These include information like closed-caption data, Teletext
 (primarily in Europe), and now Intercast and the ATVEC Internet television
 encodings.
 .
 The Zapping VBI library, in short ZVBI, provides functions to capture and
 decode VBI data. It is written in plain ANSI C with few dependencies on
 other tools and libraries, licensed under GPL. Some features:
   * Captures raw VBI samples from V4L, V4L2 and FreeBSD BKTR devices, sliced
     VBI data from Linux DVB devices;
   * Implements a VBI Proxy to share one VBI device between multiple
     applications;
   * Has a robust and versatile bit slicer which handles a wide range of data
     services;
   * Functions to capture multiple data services at once, such as Closed
     Caption (both NTSC and PAL), Teletext, VPS, WSS, XDS;
   * Level 3.5 Teletext decoder with support for all Teletext character sets,
     graphics, 4096 colors, with built-in page cache including search
     functions;
   * Closed Caption decoder which supports roll-up, pop-up and paint-on style
     caption, color, expanded character set, text attributes and free text
     placement;
   * Renders Teletext and Caption pages, can export to HTML, PNG and other
     formats.
   * Can determine network names;
   * Can find Teletext subtitle and program pages;
   * Functions to extract data transmissions in Teletext streams (currently
     Page Format Clear and Independent Data Line Format A);
   * Can multiplex and demultiplex DVB VBI PES and TS streams.

Description: Audio sample rate conversion library
 libsamplerate (aka Secret Rabbit Code) is a library for audio rate conversion.
 .
 libsamplerate currently provides three different sample rate conversion
 algorithms; zero order hold, linear interpolation and FIR filter interpolation
 (using filters derived from the mathematical SINC function). The first two
 algorithms (zero order hold and linear) are included for completeness and are
 not recommended for any application where high quality sample rate conversion
 is required. For the FIR/Sinc algorithm, three converters are provided;
 SRC_SINC_FASTEST, SRC_SINC_MEDIUM_QUALITY and SRC_SINC_BEST_QUALITY to allow a
 trade off between conversion speed and conversion quality.
 .
 libsamplerate is capable of downsampling to 1/256 of the original sample rate
 and upsampling to 256 times the original sample rate. It is also capable of
 time varying conversions for vary speed effects and synchronising of two
 unlocked sample rates.

Description: add and remove users and groups
 This package includes the 'adduser' and 'deluser' commands for creating
 and removing users.
 .
  - 'adduser' creates new users and groups and adds existing users to
    existing groups;
  - 'deluser' removes users and groups and removes users from a given
    group.
 .
 Adding users with 'adduser' is much easier than adding them manually.
 Adduser will choose appropriate UID and GID values, create a home
 directory, copy skeletal user configuration, and automate setting
 initial values for the user's password, real name and so on.
 .
 Deluser can back up and remove users' home directories
 and mail spool or all the files they own on the system.
 .
 A custom script can be executed after each of the commands.

 A number of terms are used to refer to the X Window System, including "X",
 "X Version 11", "X11", "X11R6", and "X11R7".  The version of X used in
 Debian is derived from the version released by the X.Org Foundation, and
 is thus often also referred to as "X.Org".  All of the preceding quoted
 terms are functionally interchangeable in an Debian system.

Description: secure shell (SSH) client, for secure access to remote machines
 This is the portable version of OpenSSH, a free implementation of
 the Secure Shell protocol as specified by the IETF secsh working
 group.
 .
 Ssh (Secure Shell) is a program for logging into a remote machine
 and for executing commands on a remote machine.
 It provides secure encrypted communications between two untrusted
 hosts over an insecure network. X11 connections and arbitrary TCP/IP
 ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.
 It can be used to provide applications with a secure communication
 channel.
 .
 This package provides the ssh, scp and sftp clients, the ssh-agent
 and ssh-add programs to make public key authentication more convenient,
 and the ssh-keygen, ssh-keyscan, ssh-copy-id and ssh-argv0 utilities.
 .
 In some countries it may be illegal to use any encryption at all
 without a special permit.
 .
 ssh replaces the insecure rsh, rcp and rlogin programs, which are
 obsolete for most purposes.

Description: Boost C++ Libraries development files
 The Boost web site provides free, peer-reviewed, portable C++ source
 libraries. The emphasis is on libraries which work well with the C++
 Standard Library. One goal is to establish "existing practice" and
 provide reference implementations so that the Boost libraries are
 suitable for eventual standardization. Some of the libraries have
 already been proposed for inclusion in the C++ Standards Committee's
 upcoming C++ Standard Library Technical Report.
 .
 This package provides headers for all Boost libraries.
 .
 Extended precision arithmetic package libmpfrc++-dev or libntl-dev is
 required to use the Boost.Multiprecision wrapping of the respective
 library.

 The cron daemon is a background process that runs particular programs at
 particular times (for example, every minute, day, week, or month), as
 specified in a crontab. By default, users may also create crontabs of
 their own so that processes are run on their behalf.
 .
 Output from the commands is usually mailed to the system administrator
 (or to the user in question); you should probably install a mail system
 as well so that you can receive these messages.
 .
 This cron package does not provide any system maintenance tasks. Basic
 periodic maintenance tasks are provided by other packages, such
 as checksecurity.

Description: Development files for libgraphite2
 Graphite is a system that can be used to create and use "smart fonts" capable
 of displaying writing systems with various complex behaviors, such as:
 contextual shaping, ligatures, reordering, split glyphs, bidirectionality,
 stacking diacritics and complex positioning.
 .
 This library was designed and developed by the NRSI (Non-Roman Script
 Initiative) within SIL International (www.sil.org) to act as a complement to
 other smart font rendering technologies with limited practical local
 extensibility. Its purpose is to help meet the needs of a very large number
 of "minority language" communities for local extensibility of complex script
 behaviors.
 .
 The behavior of the rendering engine for a given writing system is specified
 through extra tables added to a TrueType font.  These tables are generated by
 compiling a GDL (Graphite Description Language) source file into a font using
 grcompiler.
 .
 This package contains the development libraries for libgraphite2

 channel adapters (HCAs) and iWARP NICs commonly support direct
 hardware access from userspace (kernel bypass), and libibverbs
 supports this when available.
 .
 This package is needed to compile programs against libibverbs1.
 It contains the header files and static libraries (optionally)
 needed for compiling.

Description: tool to manage well known user directories
 xdg-user-dirs is a tool to help manage "well known" user directories
 like the desktop folder and the music folder. It also handles
 localization (i.e. translation) of the filenames.
 .
 The way it works is that xdg-user-dirs-update is run very early in the
 login phase. This program reads a configuration file, and a set of
 default directories. It then creates localized versions of these
 directories in the users home directory and sets up a config file in
 $(XDG_CONFIG_HOME)/user-dirs.dirs (XDG_CONFIG_HOME defaults to
 ~/.config) that applications can read to find these directories.

  * Size: small library and lower memory footprint
  * Latency hiding: batch several requests and wait for the replies later
  * Direct protocol access: one-to-one mapping between interface and protocol
  * Thread support: access XCB from multiple threads, with no explicit locking
  * Easy creation of new extensions: automatically generates interface from
    machine-parsable protocol descriptions

Description: Shared libraries for GSM speech compressor
 This package contains runtime shared libraries for libgsm, an
 implementation of the European GSM 06.10 provisional standard for
 full-rate speech transcoding, prI-ETS 300 036, which uses RPE/LTP
 (residual pulse excitation/long term prediction) coding at 13 kbit/s.
 .
 GSM 06.10 compresses frames of 160 13-bit samples (8 kHz sampling
 rate, i.e. a frame rate of 50 Hz) into 260 bits; for compatibility
 with typical UNIX applications, our implementation turns frames of 160
 16-bit linear samples into 33-byte frames (1650 Bytes/s).
 The quality of the algorithm is good enough for reliable speaker
 recognition; even music often survives transcoding in recognizable
 form (given the bandwidth limitations of 8 kHz sampling rate).
 .
 The interfaces offered are a front end modelled after compress(1), and
 a library API.  Compression and decompression run faster than realtime
 on most SPARCstations.  The implementation has been verified against the
 ETSI standard test patterns.

Description: wayland compositor infrastructure - EGL library
 Wayland is a protocol for a compositor to talk to its clients as well
 as a C library implementation of that protocol. The compositor can be
 a standalone display server running on Linux kernel modesetting and
 evdev input devices, an X application, or a wayland client
 itself. The clients can be traditional applications, X servers
 (rootless or fullscreen) or other display servers.
 .
 This package ships the library that implements the Wayland EGL platform
 of the Wayland protocol.

Description: SELinux library for manipulating binary security policies
 Security-enhanced Linux is a patch of the Linux kernel and a number
 of utilities with enhanced security functionality designed to add
 mandatory access controls to Linux.  The Security-enhanced Linux
 kernel contains new architectural components originally developed to
 improve the security of the Flask operating system. These
 architectural components provide general support for the enforcement
 of many kinds of mandatory access control policies, including those
 based on the concepts of Type Enforcement®, Role-based Access
 Control, and Multi-level Security.
 .
 libsepol provides an API for the manipulation of SELinux binary policies.
 It is used by checkpolicy (the policy compiler) and similar tools, as well
 as by programs like load_policy that need to perform specific transformations
 on binary policies such as customizing policy boolean settings.

 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be
 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.
 .
 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.

 The daemon can be found in the dbus package.

 faithful to the XML 1.0 recommendation and associated standards (DOM
 1.0, DOM 2.0, SAX 1.0, SAX 2.0, Namespaces, XML Schema Part 1 and
 Part 2).  It also provides experimental implementations of XML 1.1
 and DOM Level 3.0.  The parser provides high performance, modularity,

  * Latency hiding: batch several requests and wait for the replies later
  * Direct protocol access: one-to-one mapping between interface and protocol
  * Thread support: access XCB from multiple threads, with no explicit locking
  * Easy creation of new extensions: automatically generates interface from
    machine-parsable protocol descriptions

 Fontconfig is not a rasterization library, nor does it impose a
 particular rasterization library on the application. The X-specific
 library 'Xft' uses fontconfig along with freetype to specify and
 rasterize fonts.
 .
 This package contains a program to maintain the fontconfig cache
 (fc-cache), a sample program to list installed fonts (fc-list), a program
 to test the matching rules (fc-match) and a program to dump the binary
 cache files in string form (fc-cat). It no longer makes fonts managed by defoma

Description: regular expression library for C++
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 Regular expressions are a form of pattern-matching that are often
 used in text processing; many users will be familiar with the Unix
 utilities grep, sed and awk, and the programming language perl, each
 of which make extensive use of regular expressions. Traditionally C++
 users have been limited to the POSIX C APIs for manipulating regular
 expressions, and while regex does provide these APIs, they do not
 represent the best way to use the library. For example regex can cope
 with wide character strings, or search and replace operations (in a
 manner analogous to either sed or perl), something that traditional C
 libraries can not do.
